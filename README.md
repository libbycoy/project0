# Tic Tac Toe

The following game is **Tic Tac Toe** which I created at [General Assembly](http://generalassembl.ly/).

[Here is a link to the file](https://libbycoy.github.io/project0/).

The game is stuctured like a standard 2-player Tic Tac Toe game. I used Jquery's `().on('click')` function for the click features. Players can not play two times in a row and players can not change their decision after clicking.

## Key Features
* Boostrap interface
* Start again button
* 2-player game
* Notification of win
* Notification of draw
* Prevention of clicking same button twice

### Enjoy!
